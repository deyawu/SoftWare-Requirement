##  RE1: 优化Visual Studio跨平台移动应用开发的功能

- Description: Disadvantages of cross-platform mobile app development using Visual Studio

  - Q:  Microsoft has introduced his new Visual Studio, with compatibility to develop multi-platform applications for Android, iOS and windows.

    This is a very good news, for developers, that a large and reliable company produced such a thing. It can make life easier, a lot.

    But, as you know, there are always disadvantages when you get advantages. So I want to know:

    1) What is the difference between developing native apps for each platform, and using this kind of tools? What is the disadvantage compared to using for example Objective-C or Java for iOS and Android separately?

    2) Is there any dependencies in order to running developed apps on different OSs? Something like .NET framework?

    3) Is there any performance cost? Or works just like native ones?

    4) What kind of apps are supposed to be developed with such tools?

  - A: In my point of view , this not good idea to develop android or ios application in XAMARIN. First of all performance issue occurs. You can not achieve performance like native application. There are some dependencies like Xamarin compiles C# to native code, but still relies on the Mono runtime to do a lot of its work.

    Native, no cheating – this is native. But there is an overhead, it isn’t like ObjectiveC native. The apps are going to be larger – this minor stuff matters when you are trying to get the max oomph out of your very resource restrictive mobile device.

    You still need a mac for ios:-) A huge emphasis on better app patterns like MVC or MVVM, because user interface is still native. You can write about 70% reusable code using Xamarin, but the last 30% or more depending upon your app design and nature, has to be native.

    Generally speaking, in my experience, I’ve had better luck finding support and code samples for native, than for Xamarin.

    And like I said, you still need to know ObjectiveC and Java – even if you are using Xamarin.

    And Visual Studio + Xamarin = $$$$$. Plus a Xamarin developed product, while superior than HTML5 and Packaged HTML5, is going to cost you more. You have to evaluate if your needs justify the cost.

    However, in practical application, I don't think it is very useful. Consider this... If you are coding in C# then this code has to be translated into objective-C or Java, and that translation depends on the Xamarin SDK. If Apple releases 4,000 new APIs in the next release of iOS tomorrow, how long will it be before the Xamarin API allows you to call those native APIs? And multiplied by two if adding Java. If you can't wait, then you code what you can in C#, and then write native code for the rest, but now you are supporting three code bases, and the advantage of Xamarin flys out the window.





## RE2: 改善Visual Studio的配置文件功能

- Description: Do not use svcutil or visual studio 2010 to generate a config file. Why?
  - Q: In the IDesign WCF Coding Standard, one of the points Juval Lowy makes is to not use svcutil or visual studio 2010 to generate the config file. Can someone explain the advantage/disadvantage of this?
  - A: The argument is one of maintainability/readability of the config files. Lowy refers to a Visual Studio 2010 config file filled with default values as being butchered and unreadable. He recommends:





## RE3: 改善Visual studio的自动补全功能

- Description: Visual Studio Code disable angular auto complex

  - Q: can someone explain how you disable angular auto complete on visual studio code?

    Cheers

  - A: Open the editor settings and search for the 'angular1' you will find a config:

    > "html.suggest.angular1": true

    copy this line to user setting and edit it to:

    > "html.suggest.angular1": false

    Angular1 suggestion will be disable.

- Description: Auto Complex Visual Studio C#

  - Q: When typing in Visual Studio, normally to autocomplete I hit enter twice and I am returned to the line below where I am actively typing. However when I type Marg then am put into the quotes, type a number then hit enter. The last quote is taken to the next line. Is there a better way to auto complete Margin="5" ? Thanks!

    ```
    <TextBox Grid.Column="1"
    Width="250" 
    Height="20" 
    HorizontalAlignment="Left" 
    VerticalAlignment="Bottom" 
    Margin="5" 
    </Grid>
    ```

  - A: I think Visual Studio does the best it can to autocomplete your input. You have to realize that there are two different cases:

    1. An enumeration is expected between the quotes, e.g. you type

       ```
       TextA
       ```

       and then press Enter. VS autocompletes this to

       ```
       TextAlignment=""
       ```

       and puts the cursor between the quotes. You can choose a valid value from an enumeration. Lets say you press C for Center. Visual Studio puts Center between the quotes.

       ```
       TextAlignment="Center"
       ```

       Because it's a value from an enumeration, VS knows that you're done with entering something between the quotes and automatically puts the cursor one column ahead just behind the quotes. If you press Enter now, you get a new line.

    2. A free value is expected between the quotes, e.g.

       ```
       Margin="10"
       ```

       Lets say you just entered the 10. Now VS can not know if you're done with entering a value or if you want to want to key in more digits. VS can not move the cursor outside the quotes like it does with the enums. You have to leave the quotes by pressing the right arrow yourself.





## RE4: 增添Visual Studio代码颜色拾色器

- Description: Visual studio code color picker

  - Q: I love visual studio code but there's one thing that is missing in my opinion.
    A color picker.
    Does anyone know if there's a color picker for visual studio code just like in visual studio?

  - A: The extension [Color Picker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anseki.vscode-color) does actually work but you need to Install Node.Js from [this website](https://nodejs.org/), also note that when you first try to use the plugin it does an initial configuration which takes a few minutes.

  - A: In release 1.15.1 they have added a color picker.

## RE5: 改善Visual Studio对于调试时子断点难以删除的问题

- Description: Visual Studio refuses to forget breakpoints?

  - Q: Visual Studio remembers breakpoints from previous debugging sessions, which is awesome.

    However, when I'm debugging, and I clear one of these "old" breakpoints by clicking on it, it's only temporarily deleted. What I mean is the next time I debug, the breakpoint that I thought I removed is back.

    This is super annoying--is there a setting to make it not do this?

  - A: go to `Debug` menu then `Delete All Breakpoints` `Ctrl+Shift+F9`

  - A: The problem is that child breakpoints of your breakpoints persist. Child breakpoints are created (in certain situations) when setting breakpoints during a debug session.

    A surefire way of deleting a breakpoint (and children) is to manually look for it in the breakpoint window, and delete it from there. (Select the top node of the entry, hit Delete.)

    If you're running an (old) version of Visual Studio that supports VBScript macros, you could run the macro posted [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8415382/125938) (between debug sessions), to remove child breakpoints. This will make removing breakpoints by clicking the glyph somewhat more effective and predictable, but it continues to be problematic and awkward.

## RE16：优化更改起始页这一浪费时间的操作

- re/problem: Start page change is a time waster, why did it change?

  - Description: I have just loaded up Visual Studio, yesterday I had a list of around 20 applications that I am working on, all shown and pinned on the start page, today I have 7. So now I have to try and remember what the other 13 projects were that I was working on.

    Why do you insist on changing things in a away that wastes a developer's time, instead of saves it? The whole point of me customising the IDE, is to make it an efficient place to do work, so why do you then go and mess things up and make it worse?

    I can work on up to 20 projects in a day, maybe even more, so what is the point of "Today", "Yesterday" and "This Week"? Is a developer's time so worthless to you, that inconveniencing them just isn't an issue?

    As a GUI designer and developer, I absolutely despair when a GUI is redesigned for no positive reason. Adding a scrolling section means you are adding hidden components that need to be scrolled into view, that's a negative design change. I have a wide empty space with a square in the middle now and things needlessly spread out in it.

    I am sure someone thinks "Hey, that looks nice", looking nice doesn't mean efficient and a development environment needs to be efficient. Making things disappear that are relied on from day-to-day, is nothing like efficient.

    Along with the bugs you kindly added to 15.8.1, I now have to shift everything back to VS2015. So I have a freshly installed OS and a messed up IDE that's going to leave bits of itself all over the place and no doubt screw up VS2015... thanks for that. My time is so much better spent repairing other people's mess-ups, than actually creating things.

    This didn't go in user voice because this change caused me to lose visibility of existing projects... that's a bug, therefore a problem, not a suggestion.

## RE21: 对扩展程序的手动更新，以及在关闭vs后的后台更新功能

- Re/Problem: Extensions not updating

  - Description: There are a number of extensions that are waiting to be updated, and when I update it downloads the extension and says the changes are scheduled. But when I exit Visual Studio, they are not installed. The extensions include a mixture of MS and non-MS extensions.

    I can find no log file to help diagnose the problem, and can see no info in the log file when I startup VS with the /log option.

    I am using VS 2017 Enterprise v15.7.1

Is there a technical limitation why you're forcing the High Contrast theme? Or you just think you know better what the user wants?



## RE23: 增加查找和替换对注释是否生效的开关

- Re/Problem: "Find and Replace" add options to EXCLUDE lines "With a Comment" and "If Text was found in a Commented area of the line"

  - Description: "Find and Replace" is a tool very used every day from all developers, but have a *great lack*:

    **EXCLUDING from results all commented lines or line with a searched text inside a comment.**

    Despite the usefoul Ctrl+K+R the "Find and Replace" can help us in find some vars/code used in different project files (.cs, XAML, HTML, .js)

    I strongly suggest to add this easy features to the VS IDE...for you is a 2 day work for us is a new blade in the Swiss Knife aka VS ;)

    Many thanks to all for vote it.

## RE24:  对c++中的attribbutes使用高亮的不同颜色

- Re/Problem: Syntax highlighting: use a unique color for C++ attributes
  - Description: Usage of attributes in C++ is becoming more and more common place. With C++20, we get [[likely]] and [[unlikely]] attributes as static branch prediction hints for use in conditional expressions and one thing I've noticed is it would be a lot easier for our eyes to quickly parse if the attributes had a unique color. It doesn't necessarily need to sharply stand out, just something that gives us a slight distinction from function or variable names, and of course other keywords.



## RE25: 删除部分代码处绿色的无意义的波浪线

- Re/Problem: green squiggles

  - Description: Green squiggles appear everywhere in my C++ source code. Mousing over gives tooltip gives "6284: Object passed as _Param(3) when a string is required..."

    Since these messages are meaningless and incorrect, I want to disable the green squiggles (while keeping the useful red ones). There doesn't seem to be any option to do so.

    The squiggles appear even under comment lines.

    THere has been a lot of discussion about their relation to macros, but I don't see how this applies here. I am using the ASCII character set, not Unicode. In the screen shot, 's' is a CString.

    This problem just started in VS 15.9.1.

- Re/Problem: Change the Dark Mode font colors back

  - Description: The font colors using Dark Mode in VS 2019 Preview are different than they were in VS 2017 (and -preview).

    E. g.: keyword 'for' is now a weird obnoxious purple, methods are colored an unusual yellow.

    In my opinion, this is unnecessary and quite offsetting being honest. This being reversed is not what I'm intending to say. What i rather desire is a setting for it. Like a decision between new and old font colors.

## RE29: 隐藏或显示代码中的注释的功能：

- Re/Problem: Ability to hide or show documentation comments embedded in code

  - Description: Note: This applies to any language, not only C++

    **THE PROBLEM:**

    I am developing a C++ API, so I need to document every exposed function in detail, including information on parameters, return value, exceptions, side effects, intended use, etc.

    The only manageable and scalable way to write this kind of documentation and keep it in sync with the code is to use an automatic tool like Doxygen. However, this requires littering the code with comments. These comments are a real distraction when writing the actual code, or during testing and debugging sessions.

    

    **THE SOLUTION:**

    To increase productivity and improve the quality of code written with Visual Studio, I propose implementing a toggle to hide/show comments, with the following features:

    - It should recognize, out of the box, regular C++ single line comments and multi-line comments, as well as Doxygen style comments.
    - It should be possible to hide/show all comments (regardless of type), and to show/hide any combination of comment types, as selected by the user (for instance, hide Doxygen and multi-line comments, but show single line comments).
    - These functions should be available as commands (toolbar buttons with keyboard shortcuts), so that users can quickly toggle comment visibility on and off as required without interrupting their workflow.
    - When comments are hidden, they should take no vertical space. This is essential, so that more actual code can fit in a single screen. Note that approaches such as code folding and changing the text colour of comments do not fulfill this requirement.

    Bonus features:

    - Ability to add custom comment delimiters, for both single and multiple lines.
    - CodeLens could be used to show a small icon where there are hidden comments, showing the full contents when hovering over the icon (just like it is done with unit tests). This adds a little amount of vertical space, but that is acceptable.

  - Description: My settings on other computers is NOT sync. when i launch the VS 2017. If i decide to make some option changes on personal computer, it doesnt load at work. So i need to generate option file (load it on cloud) and import it after every change. There is no reason to use the accounts (just for the license)... There is possible solution in login request when you want to lunch online VS 2017 => offline without request.

    PLEASE, MAKE JUST ONE COMPLETLY WORKING VERSION OF VS 2017.



## RE32: 添加用来关闭“快速查找”窗口的快捷键

- Re/Problem: There is no easy way to close Quick Find window

  - Description: Quick Find window does not accept Escape keyboard key. There is no alternative method to close it from a macro.

    In the older versions of Visual Studio it was possible to close all temporary tool windows (such as Output, FindResults, etc) and switch to the full text editing screen by pressing a single Escape key. It was very fast and efficient way to close all temporary tools and go back to source editing.

    With adding a new and specialized Quick Find/Replace tool window it became significantly harder and now requires mouse interaction.

    Before, it was possible to assign a custom macro the the Escape key and close all unnecessary windows from there. But now, the Escape key is reserved for Window.ActivateDocumentWindow command, wich is the only way to close Quick Find from the keyboard.

    If Quick Find would process Escape key and close itself when user presses it, then it would solve the first part of the problem and free the important Escape keyboard key for other use.

    Ability to close Quick Find from a macro is also required:

    If Quick Find tool window looses its input focus (or does not get it such as when you press Ctrl-F3), then there is no way to close it from the keyboard. You have to use the mouse pointer to locate and close it. This slows things quite a bit.

    All other windows, such as vsWindowKindOutput, vsWindowKindFindResults1, vsWindowKindProperties, etc can be instantly (almost) closed from a single macro assigned to a keyboard shortkey. But the Quick Find is of special kind and we could not find any automation methods to close it.

    Steps to reproduce:

    1. From the Tools|Options|Keyboard remove Esc key assignment, such as from the Window.ActivateDocumentWindow command or assign it to another useful command.
    2. Press Ctrl-F to open Quick Find tool window.
    3. Press Escape key
       Expected: Quck Find will go away.
       Actual: Nothing happens. Quick Find keeps input focus.
