## RE1：需要支持混合模式dpi

- Re/Problem:Font is blurry due to Visual Studio not supporting mixed mode dpi / multi-display DPI awareness / changing DPI scaling without logging out
  - VS should support mixed mode dpi. Now it appears blurry when dragged from primary to secondary screen when they have different DPIs.



## RE2: 各个选项窗口应当与VS主题相匹配

- Properties tool window has theming mismatch
  - I was working through scenario #12 (ASP.NET Core + Azure) and logged into my MSA on the VM and another machine. I changed the theme of VS on the other machine and then when I went back to the VM, cloned the ASP.NET core app, after it opened, I noticed the properties window had a theming mismatch.

## RE6: 实现在不同版本下用户的个性化设置的同步性

- Import VS2010.vssettings(Fonts and Color>User Types - Enums) into VS 2017 and it not works
  - \1. Open VS 2010 and go to Tools-Options... 2. Environment-Fonts and Colors and under Display items choose 'User Types - Enums' and Item foreground choose a custom color and save it 3. Go to Tools-Import and Export settings...>Export selected environment settings to export the VS 2010 setting 4. Open VS 2017 and go to Tools-Import and Export settings..., import the VS 2010 setting file 5. Go to Tools-Options…-Environment-Fonts and Colors and check the above modified filed 'User Types - Enums', the Item foreground not be changed like VS 2010 Take some other fields in VS 2010 to reproduce the above steps and it looks like export and import work fine. Test the same filed in VS 2015 to export and import it into the VS 2017, in VS 2017 the field be changed and display like VS 2015.



## RE7： 实现对不同语言不同语句的自动化设置格式

- JavaScript Switch Case Doesn't Collapse

  - Summary:
    When using a switch statement in JavaScript, the case statements will not collapse.

    Steps to Reproduce:

    1. Create a new JavaScript file.
    2. Type code similar to this:
       switch (1) {
       case 0:
       console.log("One");
       case 1:
       console.log("Two");
       }

    Expected Results:
    The switch statement and each case statement will be collapsible by clicking buttons on the left side of the screen.

    Actual Results:
    Only the switch statement can be collapsed.

    Notes:
    This is probably caused by the lack of brackets for each case statement.

## RE9： 实现对所需头文件的自动搜索及补全

- Could we have a way to make VS search in all header files for a class or a function automatically ?

  - Hello !

    So, when I'm writing a program, I sometimes have to use a class or a function from a header not included in my project, and (that's where my suggestion comes in), I sometimes don't know in which header it is located.

    When VS detects an undefined typename or function, could we have an option (in the right-click dropdown menu maybe ?) to make it search for it in the standard header folder ? It would be so useful, especially for beginners (like myself)

    It is not vital, but would be very convenient and would make us gain much time when needed



## RE10 ： 优化VS对于Web应用程序的响应速度

- Slow IDE performance working with Web projects

  - When running Visual Studio 2017, with even small sample web applicatin, the IDE constantly is slow to respond. * Painfully slow. Like 5 Minutes to accept a single key storke. * Trying to change a tab to view a diffrent file will hang the IDE indefinitely. * Very often the IDE just hangs al togethor and the only thing I can do is close it in Task Manager and try again.

    Happens even on a fresh system reboot and VS2017 the only application running. Did not have these issues with VS2015, but you had to make the project conversions one way...

    When are the issues keeping VS2017 to be useable going to be fixed?

    

## RE11：实现对最近的模板的搜索功能

- search recent projects
  - It would be nice if you can implement a Search for the recent open Projects on the startpage of Visual Studio. Like the search of the recent templates.



## RE12: 优化Android开发，解决Android开发不稳定问题

- Android development very unstable

  - I hope to add more information to this bug report but I thought I’d at least create a ‘heads up’ for the VS development team. I’m finding preview 2 to be horribly unstable and unreliable for Android development. Our existing project, which, seemed fine is now exhibiting the following issues despite very vew code changes:

    - App sometimes fails to log onto to our server. We randomly get a weird InvalidOperationException from IdentityModel.OidcClient 2.6.0 that we’ve never seen before.
    - Our encryption provider is suddenly throwing array out of range errors (possibly this issue https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/23311#issuecomment-325385891) when it never did before and we’ve had to disable it to continue development.
    - I’m getting frequent random debugger crashes and drop outs. The trace for one is given below:

    ```
    The thread 0x4 has exited with code 0 (0x0).

## RE13： 优化起始页的页面布局

- Start page: Too much white space to the left
  - The new start page is very useful, especially that you can close the Getting started section. however in my view it should make better use of horizontal space, it should take up the 100% of the width (or atleast be left adjusted) instead of having those vertical bars on either side. The width of each section is alright, however the news is a bit squashed on the right, even when there is plenty of space. i'd atleeast perfer to have the main dark gray section all the way to the left, and skip the light gray background (just keeping the dark gray though out) the news section should have a bigger max width as well



## RE14：实现对属性窗口的配置的记忆与保留

- Properties Window does not retain configuration

Now this configuration is lost everytime Visual Studio restarts.



## RE15： 优化VS在任务栏的图标显示

- Pinned taskbar icon duplicates
  - I pinned VS2017 RC to my Taskbar. When I click it, it will still show me a new icon for the starting VS 2017 instance. If I right click that one, it offers me to unpin this new icon. So it detects that it is pinned, but still creates a new icon. If I close VS 2017, then this new icon goes away. The actual pinned icon never activates.

## RE17：扩大菜单栏的点击区域

- Expand menu title hit area when maximised

  - As you’ve now gone with the ‘menus in the title bar’ approach to give more screen space to code, which is great, when the window is maximised the menu titles are now all at the top of the screen.

    However their hit rectangles do not actually touch the top of the screen so you still have to carefully aim at the text. It would be a nice improvement to extend the hit box right to the top of the screen when the window is maximised so you can just ‘throw’ the mouse up and only have to aim horizontally (like on MacOS).



## RE18: 实现代码审查功能的可用性

- Make code review feature usable

  - Migrated from [Azure DevOps UserVoice forum](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/330519/suggestions/2670048)

    The current philosophy seems to be that only active team members can participate in code reviews which are always made for one check-in. Here are a few suggestions on how to make it more usable. 1) Make it web-based so one doesn't need Visual Studio (and sources for entire solution). This way one could easily ask for consultancy from a remote expert 2) Make it possible to create review request afterwards and possibly spanning multiple check-ins. The current practise suggests people to do huge check-ins which is not a best practise. 3) Have the comments to make a discussion tree. Currently comments are plain comments and one can't reply to a comment, so a real conversation is not possible using this feature. 4) The process of adding a comment (right click -> add comment -> write -> save (or using shortcuts left mouse click -> ctrl+shift+k -> write -> ctrl+enter) is not as fluent as it could be. Just clicking the source in code review window could open a new comment box. And a plain enter on this box could save it.



## RE19: 添加更多的快捷键功能，加入用户自定义快捷键

- There is no easy way to close Quick Find window

  - Quick Find window does not accept Escape keyboard key. There is no alternative method to close it from a macro.

    In the older versions of Visual Studio it was possible to close all temporary tool windows (such as Output, FindResults, etc) and switch to the full text editing screen by pressing a single Escape key. It was very fast and efficient way to close all temporary tools and go back to source editing.

    With adding a new and specialized Quick Find/Replace tool window it became significantly harder and now requires mouse interaction.

    Before, it was possible to assign a custom macro the the Escape key and close all unnecessary windows from there. But now, the Escape key is reserved for Window.ActivateDocumentWindow command, wich is the only way to close Quick Find from the keyboard.

    If Quick Find would process Escape key and close itself when user presses it, then it would solve the first part of the problem and free the important Escape keyboard key for other use.

    Ability to close Quick Find from a macro is also required:

    If Quick Find tool window looses its input focus (or does not get it such as when you press Ctrl-F3), then there is no way to close it from the keyboard. You have to use the mouse pointer to locate and close it. This slows things quite a bit.

    All other windows, such as vsWindowKindOutput, vsWindowKindFindResults1, vsWindowKindProperties, etc can be instantly (almost) closed from a single macro assigned to a keyboard shortkey. But the Quick Find is of special kind and we could not find any automation methods to close it.

    Steps to reproduce:

    1. From the Tools|Options|Keyboard remove Esc key assignment, such as from the Window.ActivateDocumentWindow command or assign it to another useful command.
    2. Press Ctrl-F to open Quick Find tool window.
    3. Press Escape key
       Expected: Quck Find will go away.
       Actual: Nothing happens. Quick Find keeps input focus.



## RE20: 删除代码下的绿色波浪线提示符

- Re/Problem: green squiggles

  - Description: Green squiggles appear everywhere in my C++ source code. Mousing over gives tooltip gives "6284: Object passed as _Param(3) when a string is required..."

    Since these messages are meaningless and incorrect, I want to disable the green squiggles (while keeping the useful red ones). There doesn't seem to be any option to do so.

    The squiggles appear even under comment lines.

    THere has been a lot of discussion about their relation to macros, but I don't see how this applies here. I am using the ASCII character set, not Unicode. In the screen shot, 's' is a CString.

    This problem just started in VS 15.9.1.
